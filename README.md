- 👋 Hi, I’m Randall Clark, a PhD student at UCSD working in computational physics applications to nuerophysical, nuclear fission, and fluid dynamical/oceanic problems
- 👀 I’m interested in data science, Dynamical model forecasting, applications of data science to physics problems
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about radial basis functions applications to Data Driven Forecasting, fluid dynamics, Tokomak nuclear reactors
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on applicable problems to our world using the tools I've developed in data science with the community
- 📫 How to reach me email is the best way, RandarserousRex@Gmail.com (a silly gmail, yes I know)

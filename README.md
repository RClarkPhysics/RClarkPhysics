- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Randall Clark, a PhD graduate from UCSD that has worked in computational physics applications to nuerophysical, nuclear fusion, and fluid dynamical/oceanic problems. Currently I work on machine learning problem applications to nucelar fusion and plasma physics in tokomaks.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested Machine Learning and Computational appliactions to physics problems involving plasma physics and nuclear fusion as well as other applications of ML to physics problems.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about Machine learning methods of normalizing flows, generative models,, plasma physics, and Tokomak nuclear reactors
- ðŸ“« How to reach me email is the best way, RandarserousRex@Gmail.com

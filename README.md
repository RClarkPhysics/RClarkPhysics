- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Randall Clark, a UCSD Physics Postdoc that has worked in computational/machine learning physics applications to nuerophysical, nuclear fusion, and fluid dynamical/oceanic problems. Currently I work on machine learning problem applications to nucelar fusion and plasma physics in tokomaks.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested Machine Learning and Computational physics applications to challenging problems.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: email is the best way, r2clark@ucsd.edu
